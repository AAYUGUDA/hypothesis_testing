## Hypothesis Testing Report: Investigating Gender and Racial Pay Gaps at Spark Fortress

## Introduction:

In today's vibrant business environment, it is essential to encourage variety and incorporation by guaranteeing equal compensation for individuals of varying genders and races. This report aims to investigate the potential for gender and racial compensation disparities within Spark Fortress, a prominent company in its sector.
The objective of this study is to examine two null hypotheses:

1. Hypothesis on Gender Pay Gap: There is no significant disparity in average salaries between male and female employees at Spark Fortress.
  
2. Hypothesis on Racial Pay Gap: There is no significant difference in average salaries between Caucasian employees and employees belonging to other racial backgrounds at Spark Fortress.
   
These hypotheses are grounded in the idea of pay, where gender or ethnicity should not influence one’s salary. Through this analysis, the aim is to determine if there are any disparities in employee compensation within our company. The findings from this study will contribute to the discourse on salary equality at Spark Fortress. May provide valuable insights for future initiatives aimed at creating a more diverse and equitable workplace. Subsequent sections of this report will delve into an examination of the results.

## Results:

### The results of Part I from the data sample are as follows:

|   Overall   | n   |   	 Mean       |   	Sample variance     |
|-------------|-----|-----------------|-------------------------|
|   Female    |  98 |   $ 65,736.91   |    $² 1,086,417,843.72  |
|    Male     |	76  | 	$ 72,300.53   | 	 $² 1,225,097,027.53  |

Pooled variance = $²1,146,888,418.06 '

T-score= 1.27

p-value = 0.103

### The results of part II from data sample are as follows:
|   Overall   | n   |   	 Mean       |   	Sample variance     |
|-------------|-----|-----------------|-------------------------|
|    White    | 112 |   $ 67,323.10   |    $² 1,136,728,018.03  |
|  Non-White  |	62  |  	$ 70,917.26   |    $² 1,225,049,916.30  |
		 	 		  	 
Pooled variance = $²1,168,051,481.95  

T-score=0.66 

p-value=0.510

## Conclusion:

### Based on the result from part I:
The p-value, which measures the significance is 0.103 surpassing the accepted threshold of 0.05. As a result, the hypothesis cannot be dismissed since there is no discrepancy, in the average salaries, between male and female employees. Therefore, based on this dataset and considering a significance level of 5% there is a lack of evidence to assert the presence of a gender pay gap.

### Based on the result from part II:
The p-value, which measures the significance is 0.510 surpassing the accepted threshold of 0.05. As a result, the hypothesis cannot dismissed since there is no discrepancy, in the average salaries, between Caucasian and non-Caucasian employees. Therefore, based on this dataset and considering a significance level of 5% there lack evidence to assert the presence of a racial pay gap.
